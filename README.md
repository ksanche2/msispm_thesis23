# MSISPM Thesis 2023
The goal of this project is to show a proof-of-concept model that prioritizes the output of Cppcheck by mapping the errors to requirements documents. The model prioritizes those errors that are most similar to the requirements, because this indicates that the requirements are not met and those errors should be addressed first.
